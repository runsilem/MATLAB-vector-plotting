# 📈 Vector Plotting in MATLAB

This repository contains a MATLAB script that demonstrates vector plotting techniques using sample data. The project is based on tasks from the [MATLAB Onramp course](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/v1/portal.html?course=gettingstarted#chapter=9v1&lesson=1&section=1) and showcases how to visualize relationships between density, velocity, and mass.

## 🧪 Project Overview

- Loads vector data from a `.mat` file
- Computes mass from density and velocity
- Plots various relationships using different styles and markers
- Demonstrates use of `plot`, `hold on`, `LineWidth`, and marker customization

## 📁 Files

- `vector_plotting.m`: Main script with all plotting tasks completed
- *(Optional)* `datafile.mat`: Required data file containing the `data` matrix

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the `.m` file.
2. Ensure `datafile.mat` is in the same folder.
3. Open MATLAB and run `vector_plotting.m`.
